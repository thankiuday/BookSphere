If  your  customers  wish  to  see  your  \nbusiness online and have instant access to your products or services.  \nOnline  Shopping  is  a  lifestyle  e-commerce  web  application,  which  retails  various  fashion  and  \nlifestyle   products   (Currently   Men’s   Wear).   This   project   allows   viewing   various   products   \navailable enables registered users to purchase desired products instantly using PayPal payment \nprocessor  (Instant  Pay)  and  also  can  place  order  by  using  Cash  on  Delivery  (Pay  Later)  option.  \nThis  project  provides  an  easy  access  to  Administrators  and  Managers  to  view  orders  placed  \nusing Pay Later and Instant Pay options.",

These include multi-tiered architecture, server and client side scripting techniques, \nimplementation   technologies   such   as   ASP.NET,   programming   language   (such   as   C#)   and \nrelational  databases. This  is  a  project  with  the  objective  to  develop  a  basic  website  where  a  \nconsumer is provided with a shopping cart application and also to know about the technologies \nused to develop such an application. \nThis document will discuss each of the underlying  technologies to create and implement an e-\ncommerce website.",

More and more \nbusiness houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial \ntransactions  over  the  web.  It  is  reasonable  to  say  that  the  process  of  shopping  on  the  web  is  \nbecoming commonplace. \n \nThe objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where product \nlike  clothes  can  be  bought  from  the  comfort  of  home  through  the  Internet.  However,  for  \nimplementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for clothes. \n \nAn online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and \nselect products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout \ntime,  the  items  in  the  shopping  cart  will  be  presented  as  an  order.  At  that  time,  more",
